## üé® Code Style

### Go Code Style

Follow standard Go conventions:

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add godoc comments for exported functions

Example:
```go
// CalculateScore computes the score for a given board position
func CalculateScore(board *Board, player Player) int {
    // Implementation
}
```

### JavaScript/React Code Style

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the winner of the game
 * @param {Array} board - The game board
 * @returns {number|null} The winning player or null
 */
const calculateWinner = (board) => {
    // Implementation
};
```

### CSS Style

- Use BEM naming convention
- Keep selectors specific but not overly nested
- Use CSS variables for colors and common values
- Mobile-first responsive design
