# 📊 Kafka in This Project - Complete Explanation

Let me explain **exactly** how Kafka works in your 4 in a Row game, step by step.

---

## 🎯 What is Kafka?

**Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform** - think of it as a super-fast postal service for your application that:
- **Never loses messages** (events are stored safely)
- **Handles high volume** (thousands of events per second)
- **Allows multiple consumers** (many services can read the same events)
- **Processes events in order** (first event in, first event out)

**Real-world analogy**: Imagine a post office where:
- **Producer** = Person sending letters (Backend)
- **Kafka** = Post office storing letters in mailboxes (Message broker)
- **Topic** = A specific mailbox (game-events)
- **Consumer** = Person receiving letters (Analytics service)

## 🏗️ Architecture in Your Project

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    GAME FLOW                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. Player makes a move in browser
   └─► Frontend sends WebSocket message to Backend

2. Backend validates & updates game state
   └─► Backend sends event to Kafka

3. Kafka stores the event in "game-events" topic
   └─► Event is safely persisted (won't be lost)

4. Analytics service reads from Kafka
   └─► Processes event and stores in database

5. Leaderboard queries database
   └─► Shows updated statistics to users
```

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step: What Happens When You Play

### **Step 1: Player Makes a Move**

```javascript
// Frontend (Game.js)
const handleColumnClick = (column) => {
  wsService.send('move', { column });
};
```

**What happens**: You click column 3 → Frontend sends `{"type":"move","payload":{"column":3}}` via WebSocket

---

### **Step 2: Backend Processes Move**

```go
// Backend (websocket.go)
func (s *Server) handleMove(c *Client, payload map[string]interface{}) {
    // 1. Validate move
    column := int(payload["column"].(float64))
    
    // 2. Update game state
    game, err := s.gameManager.MakeMove(c.playerID, column)
    
    // 3. Send event to Kafka
    s.kafkaProducer.SendGameEvent(kafka.GameEvent{
        EventType: "move_made",
        GameID:    game.ID,
        PlayerID:  c.playerID,
        Column:    column,
        Timestamp: time.Now(),
    })
    
    // 4. Broadcast to both players
    s.broadcastGameState(game.ID)
}
```

**What happens**: 
- Backend validates your move is legal
- Updates the game board in memory
- **Sends event to Kafka** ← This is the key part!
- Sends updated board to both players

---

### **Step 3: Kafka Producer Sends Event**

**File**: `backend/internal/kafka/producer.go`

```go
// Backend (kafka/producer.go)
func (p *Producer) SendGameEvent(event GameEvent) error {
    // Convert event to JSON
    eventJSON, _ := json.Marshal(event)
    
    // Send to Kafka topic "game-events"
    return p.writer.WriteMessages(context.Background(),
        kafka.Message{
            Key:   []byte(event.GameID),
            Value: eventJSON,
            Time:  time.Now(),
        },
    )
}
```

**What happens**:
- Event is converted to JSON:
```json
{
  "event_type": "move_made",
  "game_id": "abc-123",
  "player_id": "player-1",
  "column": 3,
  "timestamp": "2024-10-28T10:30:45Z"
}
```
- Sent to Kafka topic `game-events`
- Kafka stores it on disk (persisted)

---

### **Step 4: Analytics Service Consumes Event**

**File**: `analytics/main.go`

```go
// Analytics (main.go)
func main() {
    // Create Kafka consumer
    reader := kafka.NewReader(kafka.ReaderConfig{
        Brokers: []string{"kafka:29092"},
        Topic:   "game-events",
        GroupID: "analytics-consumer",
    })
    
    // Read messages in a loop
    for {
        msg, _ := reader.ReadMessage(context.Background())
        
        // Parse JSON event
        var event GameEvent
        json.Unmarshal(msg.Value, &event)
        
        // Process based on event type
        switch event.EventType {
        case "game_started":
            recordGameStart(event)
        case "move_made":
            recordMove(event)
        case "game_finished":
            recordGameEnd(event)
            updateLeaderboard(event)
        }
    }
}
```

**What happens**:
- Analytics service continuously reads from `game-events` topic
- Parses each JSON event
- Stores data in PostgreSQL tables:
  - `game_analytics` - All game events
  - `game_stats` - Aggregated statistics
  - Updates user win/loss/draw counts (for leaderboard)

## 🔍 Types of Events Sent to Kafka

### 1. **Game Started Event**

**When**: Two players are matched (or bot joins after timeout)

```json
{
  "event_type": "game_started",
  "game_id": "abc-123",
  "player1": "Alice",
  "player2": "Bob",
  "timestamp": 1698485400
}
```

**Code Location**: `backend/internal/game/manager.go` - `emitGameStartedEvent()`

---

### 2. **Move Made Event**

**When**: Player drops a disc in a column

```json
{
  "event_type": "move",
  "game_id": "abc-123",
  "player": "Alice",
  "column": 3,
  "row": 5,
  "timestamp": 1698485415
}
```

**Code Location**: `backend/internal/game/manager.go` - `emitMoveEvent()`

---

### 3. **Game Finished Event**

**When**: Player wins or game ends in draw

```json
{
  "event_type": "game_ended",
  "game_id": "abc-123",
  "winner": "Alice",
  "result": "win",
  "duration": 180.5,
  "timestamp": 1698485580
}
```

**Code Location**: `backend/internal/game/manager.go` - `emitGameEndedEvent()`

---

## 🗄️ What Gets Stored in Database

After Kafka consumer processes events, data is stored in PostgreSQL:

### **game_analytics Table**
Stores every single event for audit trail.

| id  | event_type   | game_id | player | column | timestamp  |
|-----|-------------|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1   | game_started| abc-123 | -      | -      | 10:30:00   |
| 2   | move        | abc-123 | Alice  | 3      | 10:30:15   |
| 3   | move        | abc-123 | Bob    | 4      | 10:30:20   |
| 4   | game_ended  | abc-123 | Alice  | -      | 10:33:00   |

### **game_stats Table**
Aggregated statistics for analytics.

| game_id | player1 | player2 | winner | duration | moves | created_at |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|----------|-------|------------|
| abc-123 | Alice   | Bob     | Alice  | 180      | 21    | 2024-10-28 |

### **games Table**
Main game records with winner information.

| id      | player1_id | player2_id | winner_id | status   | result |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| abc-123 | user-1    | user-2     | user-1    | finished | win    |

### **users Table (Leaderboard)**
Updated after each game ends.

| id      | username | games_played | wins | losses | draws | score |
|---------|----------|--------------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| user-1  | Alice    | 10           | 7    | 2      | 1     | 21    |
| user-2  | Bob      | 8            | 3    | 4      | 1     | 9     |

## 🎥 How to See Kafka Working (Live Proof)

### **Method 1: Kafka Web UI (Easiest)**

```bash
# 1. Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Wait 30 seconds for startup

# 3. Open Kafka UI
http://localhost:8090
```

**What to do**:
1. Click **Topics** in left menu
2. Click on **game-events** topic
3. Click **Messages** tab
4. Open another tab: http://localhost:3000
5. Play a game (join, make moves)
6. Go back to Kafka UI and refresh
7. You'll see live JSON events!

**Screenshot this for proof!** ✅

---

### **Method 2: Check Analytics Logs**

```powershell
# View analytics service logs
docker-compose logs analytics --tail=50 -f
```

**You'll see**:
```
analytics  | Processing event: game_started for game abc-123
analytics  | Processing event: move for game abc-123
analytics  | Processing event: move for game abc-123
analytics  | Processing event: game_ended for game abc-123
analytics  | Updated leaderboard for player Alice
```

---

### **Method 3: Query Database**

```powershell
# Connect to database
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d four_in_a_row

# Query events from Kafka
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM game_analytics 
GROUP BY event_type;
```

**Output**:
```
   event_type   | count 
----------------+-------
 game_started   |    42
 move          |   687
 game_ended    |    38
```

## 🤔 Why Use Kafka? (Interview Answer)

### **Problem Without Kafka** ❌

```
┌──────────┐
│ Backend  │──────► Database
└──────────┘
     │
     └─ Problem: If database is slow, game freezes!
     └─ Problem: Can't add new analytics without changing backend
     └─ Problem: High coupling (backend depends on database)
     └─ Problem: If database is down, events are lost
```

### **Solution With Kafka** ✅

```
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│ Backend  │─────►│  Kafka   │─────►│Analytics │─────►│ Database │
└──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘
     
Benefits:
✅ Backend never waits for database
✅ Events are never lost (Kafka stores them)
✅ Can add more consumers without changing backend
✅ Decoupled architecture (microservices pattern)
✅ Events can be replayed if needed
✅ Asynchronous processing
```

### **Kafka Configuration in Code**

#### **Producer Configuration (Backend)**

**File**: `backend/internal/kafka/producer.go`

```go
func NewProducer(brokers []string) (*Producer, error) {
    writer := &kafka.Writer{
        Addr:         kafka.TCP(brokers...),
        Topic:        "game-events",
        Balancer:     &kafka.LeastBytes{},
        WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
        ReadTimeout:  10 * time.Second,
    }
    return &Producer{writer: writer}, nil
}
```

**Key Settings**:
- `Topic`: "game-events" - All game events go here
- `Balancer`: Load balances messages across partitions
- `WriteTimeout`: Max time to wait for Kafka response

---

#### **Consumer Configuration (Analytics)**

**File**: `analytics/main.go`

```go
reader := kafka.NewReader(kafka.ReaderConfig{
    Brokers:        []string{"kafka:29092"},
    Topic:          "game-events",
    GroupID:        "analytics-group",
    MinBytes:       10e3,  // 10KB
    MaxBytes:       10e6,  // 10MB
    CommitInterval: time.Second,
})
```

**Key Settings**:
- `GroupID`: "analytics-group" - Consumer group for scaling
- `MinBytes/MaxBytes`: Batch size optimization
- `CommitInterval`: How often to commit offsets

## 🎯 Quick Summary (Elevator Pitch)

**30-second explanation**:

> "Kafka acts as a message queue between our game backend and analytics service. When players make moves, the backend sends events to Kafka instead of directly writing to the database. This makes the game faster since the backend doesn't wait for database writes. The analytics service reads these events asynchronously and updates the leaderboard. It's the same pattern used by Netflix and Uber for real-time data processing."

**One-line explanation**:

> "Kafka decouples our game logic from analytics, enabling asynchronous event processing for better performance and scalability."

## 📊 Kafka Event Streaming

This project uses Apache Kafka for real-time game analytics.

### Architecture
- **Backend** produces game events (start, move, end)
- **Kafka** stores events in `game-events` topic
- **Analytics** service consumes events asynchronously
- **PostgreSQL** stores processed analytics

### Live Monitoring
View Kafka events in real-time: http://localhost:8090

![Kafka Events](docs/kafka-proof/kafka-messages.png)

### Event Types
- `game_started` - New game begins
- `move` - Player makes a move
- `game_ended` - Game finishes with winner

## ❓ Common Interview Questions & Answers

### **Q1: Why not just write directly to the database?**

**A**: Direct database writes would:
- Block the game while waiting for DB response (slow UX)
- Couple backend tightly to database schema
- Make it hard to add new analytics consumers
- Risk losing events if database is temporarily down

Kafka provides:
- Asynchronous processing (game responds instantly)
- Event replay capability (can reprocess old events)
- Multiple consumers (can add ML service, notifications, etc.)
- Fault tolerance (events queued if consumer is down)

---

### **Q2: What if Kafka is down?**

**A**: 
1. **Short-term**: Events are buffered in backend memory and retried
2. **Production**: Kafka runs with 3+ broker replicas for high availability
3. **Fallback**: Backend can write critical events to database directly
4. **Monitoring**: Alerts notify team immediately if Kafka is unhealthy

---

### **Q3: How does Kafka guarantee message order?**

**A**: 
- Messages with the same key (e.g., `game_id`) go to the same partition
- Within a partition, messages are strictly ordered (FIFO)
- This ensures all events for one game are processed in sequence
- Example: Move 1, Move 2, Move 3 for game "abc-123" stay in order

---

### **Q4: How is this different from a message queue like RabbitMQ?**

**A**:

| Feature | Kafka | RabbitMQ |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Event streaming | Task queuing |
| **Storage** | Persists events (replay possible) | Deletes after consumption |
| **Throughput** | Very high (millions/sec) | Moderate |
| **Use case** | Analytics, logs, event sourcing | Job queues, RPC |
| **Complexity** | More complex | Simpler |

Kafka is better for our use case because we want to keep historical events for analytics.

---

### **Q5: What happens if the analytics service crashes?**

**A**:
- Events stay in Kafka (they're not deleted)
- When analytics restarts, it resumes from last committed offset
- No events are lost
- Consumer groups track progress automatically
- In production, we'd run multiple analytics instances for redundancy

---

### **Q6: How do you handle duplicate events?**

**A**:
- Use **idempotent processing**: Check if event already processed before storing
- Store event ID in database to detect duplicates
- Kafka's "exactly-once semantics" (in production config)
- Example: Before inserting move, check if move_id already exists

---

### **Q7: Can you scale this to millions of users?**

**A**: Yes, by:
1. **Kafka partitions**: Split topic into multiple partitions
2. **Consumer groups**: Run multiple analytics instances (each handles different partitions)
3. **Backend scaling**: Run multiple backend instances (all send to same Kafka)
4. **Database sharding**: Partition database by game_id or user_id
5. **Caching**: Add Redis for leaderboard queries

---

## 🚀 Advanced Topics (Bonus Points)

### **Event Sourcing Pattern**

Our Kafka setup follows **Event Sourcing**:
- Store events, not current state
- Game state can be reconstructed by replaying events
- Complete audit trail of every action
- Example: Can replay entire game by processing all move events

### **CQRS Pattern**

Separation of **Command** (write) and **Query** (read):
- **Command**: Backend writes events to Kafka
- **Query**: Frontend reads from optimized read models (leaderboard)
- Kafka enables this separation naturally

### **Stream Processing**

Could add **real-time analytics** with Kafka Streams:
```go
// Calculate average game duration in real-time
stream := kafka.NewStream("game-events")
stream.GroupBy("event_type", "game_ended")
      .Aggregate(CalculateAverage)
      .To("game-metrics")
```

docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d four_in_a_row -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_analytics;"

# 8. Show analytics logs
docker-compose logs analytics --tail=20
```

**Key points to mention**:
- "Events flow through Kafka in milliseconds"
- "Backend never waits for database"
- "Can add new consumers without touching backend"
- "Same pattern used by Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn"

## 🎉 Summary

**Kafka in your project**:
- ✅ Backend produces game events
- ✅ Kafka stores events reliably
- ✅ Analytics consumes events asynchronously
- ✅ Database stores processed analytics
- ✅ Leaderboard shows real-time stats

**Why it matters**:
- Professional, production-grade architecture
- Same technology used by FAANG companies
- Demonstrates understanding of distributed systems
- Shows ability to design scalable applications

**For your interview**:
> "I implemented Kafka event streaming to decouple game logic from analytics, enabling asynchronous processing and real-time leaderboard updates. This follows the same event-driven architecture pattern used by Netflix and Uber."
