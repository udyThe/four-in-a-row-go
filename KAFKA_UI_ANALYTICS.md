## What You'll See in Kafka UI

This guide shows you exactly what analytics and metrics are visible in Kafka UI at **http://localhost:8090**

## 🎯 Real-Time Metrics Visible in Kafka UI

### 1. **System Metrics** (Every 60 seconds)

These are automatically emitted every minute to show:

```json
{
  "event_type": "system_metrics",
  "timestamp": 1730304000,
  "timestamp_iso": "2025-10-30T14:35:00Z",
  "hour_of_day": 14,
  "day_of_week": "Wednesday",
  "date": "2025-10-30",
  
  "total_active_games": 12,
  "games_in_progress": 8,
  "games_waiting": 2,
  "games_finished_cache": 2,
  "bot_games": 5,
  "human_vs_human_games": 3,
  
  "total_players": 16,
  "connected_players": 14,
  "disconnected_players": 2,
  
  "memory_alloc_mb": 45,
  "memory_total_mb": 123,
  "num_goroutines": 67,
  "num_gc_cycles": 12,
  
  "estimated_games_per_hour": 480,
  "estimated_requests_per_hour": 1680
}
```

**What This Shows:**
- ✅ How many players are currently connected
- ✅ How many games are active right now
- ✅ Estimated games per hour
- ✅ Estimated Kafka requests per hour
- ✅ System resource usage

### 2. **Game Started Events**

Every time a game starts:

```json
{
  "event_type": "game_started",
  "game_id": "abc-123-def",
  "player1": "Alice",
  "player2": "Bob",
  "timestamp": 1730304120,
  "timestamp_iso": "2025-10-30T14:37:00Z",
  "hour_of_day": 14,
  "day_of_week": "Wednesday",
  
  "active_games": 13,
  "total_players": 18,
  "is_bot_game": false
}
```

**What This Shows:**
- ✅ When game started (hour and day)
- ✅ How many total active games at that moment
- ✅ How many players connected at that moment
- ✅ Whether it's a bot game or human vs human

### 3. **Move Made Events**

Every move generates an event:

```json
{
  "event_type": "move_made",
  "game_id": "abc-123-def",
  "player": "Alice",
  "column": 3,
  "row": 2,
  "timestamp": 1730304125,
  "timestamp_iso": "2025-10-30T14:37:05Z",
  "hour_of_day": 14,
  
  "move_number": 5,
  "is_bot_move": false
}
```

**What This Shows:**
- ✅ Frequency of moves (requests per second/minute)
- ✅ Which hour has most activity
- ✅ Bot vs Human move patterns

### 4. **Game Finished Events**

When a game ends:

```json
{
  "event_type": "game_finished",
  "game_id": "abc-123-def",
  "player1": "Alice",
  "player2": "Bot",
  "winner": "Alice",
  "result": "win",
  "duration": 145.5,
  "timestamp": 1730304180,
  "timestamp_iso": "2025-10-30T14:38:00Z",
  "hour_of_day": 14,
  "day_of_week": "Wednesday",
  
  "total_moves": 23,
  "active_games": 12,
  "total_players": 16,
  "game_duration_sec": 145,
  "was_bot_game": true
}
```

**What This Shows:**
- ✅ Games completed per hour
- ✅ Average game duration
- ✅ Total moves per game
- ✅ Peak hours for game completion

## 📊 How to View Analytics in Kafka UI

### Step 1: Access Kafka UI
```
http://localhost:8090
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Topics
1. Click "four-in-a-row" cluster
2. Click "Topics" in sidebar
3. Click "game-events" topic

### Step 3: View Messages
1. Click "Messages" tab
2. You'll see all events streaming in real-time
3. Each message shows full JSON with all metrics

### Step 4: Filter by Event Type
In the Messages tab, you can search:
- `"event_type":"system_metrics"` - See hourly stats
- `"event_type":"game_started"` - See game starts
- `"event_type":"move_made"` - See all moves
- `"event_type":"game_finished"` - See completions

### Step 5: View Topic Statistics
In the "Overview" tab, you'll see:
- **Total Messages**: Total events processed
- **Messages/sec**: Kafka throughput
- **Consumer Lag**: How fast analytics service processes

## 📈 Analytics You Can Calculate

### Games Per Hour
1. Filter messages by `"hour_of_day": 14`
2. Count `game_started` events for that hour
3. Or look at `system_metrics` → `estimated_games_per_hour`

### Players Per Hour
1. Look at `system_metrics` events
2. Check `connected_players` field
3. Track changes over time

### Kafka Requests Per Hour
1. Go to Topics → game-events → Overview
2. See "Messages" count
3. Compare over time for hourly rate
4. Or check `system_metrics` → `estimated_requests_per_hour`

### Peak Activity Hours
1. Filter by `"event_type": "game_started"`
2. Group by `hour_of_day`
3. Count events per hour
4. Find hour with most games

### Daily Activity
1. Filter by `"date": "2025-10-30"`
2. Count all events for that day
3. Compare with other days

## 🔥 Real-Time Monitoring

### Current Active Games
Look at latest `system_metrics` event:
- `total_active_games` - Games in system
- `games_in_progress` - Currently playing
- `games_waiting` - Waiting for opponent

### Current Connected Players
Look at latest `system_metrics` event:
- `total_players` - Total players in system
- `connected_players` - Currently online
- `disconnected_players` - Disconnected but in grace period

### System Health
Look at latest `system_metrics` event:
- `memory_alloc_mb` - Memory usage
- `num_goroutines` - Concurrent processes
- `num_gc_cycles` - Garbage collection activity

## 📊 Example: Finding Peak Hour

### Method 1: Manual Count
1. Go to Kafka UI → Messages
2. Filter by date: `"date":"2025-10-30"`
3. Search for `"event_type":"game_started"`
4. Group by `hour_of_day` mentally
5. Count events per hour

### Method 2: Use System Metrics
1. Filter `"event_type":"system_metrics"`
2. Look at different hours
3. Compare `games_in_progress` values
4. Highest value = peak hour

## 🎯 Sample Analytics Queries

### How many games started today?
```
Filter: "event_type":"game_started" AND "date":"2025-10-30"
Count: All matching messages
```

### What's the busiest hour?
```
Filter: "event_type":"system_metrics"
Sort by: "games_in_progress" (descending)
Look at: "hour_of_day" field
```

### How many players online right now?
```
Filter: "event_type":"system_metrics"
Sort by: timestamp (latest first)
Look at: "connected_players" field
```

### Average game duration?
```
Filter: "event_type":"game_finished"
Extract: "game_duration_sec" values
Calculate: Average of all values
```

### Bot vs Human games ratio?
```
Filter: "event_type":"game_started"
Count: "is_bot_game":true
Count: "is_bot_game":false
Calculate: Ratio
```

## 🔍 Interpreting the Data

### `estimated_games_per_hour: 480`
- Means at current rate: ~8 games/minute
- Extrapolated to hour: 480 games
- Updated every minute

### `estimated_requests_per_hour: 1680`
- Each connected player: ~2 requests/minute
- Multiplied by player count
- Extrapolated to hour
- Includes: moves, heartbeats, reconnects

### `games_in_progress: 8`
- Snapshot of current moment
- Changes dynamically
- Peak value = busiest time

### `hour_of_day: 14`
- 24-hour format (14 = 2 PM)
- Group by this to find peak hours
- Compare across different hours

## 🚀 Testing Your Analytics

### Generate Test Data
```bash
# 1. Start all services
docker-compose up

# 2. Play 10 games quickly
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Play multiple games

# 3. View Kafka UI
# Open http://localhost:8090
# See events streaming in real-time

# 4. Wait 1 minute
# See system_metrics event appear

# 5. Compare metrics
# Before games: "active_games": 0
# After games: "active_games": 5
# See the difference!
```

### Verify Hourly Tracking
```
1. Note current hour (e.g., 14 = 2 PM)
2. Play 5 games
3. Check all events show "hour_of_day": 14
4. Wait until next hour
5. Play 3 more games  
6. See events show "hour_of_day": 15
7. Compare counts!
```
